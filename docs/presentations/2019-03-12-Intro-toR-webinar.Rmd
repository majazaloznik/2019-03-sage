# Outline

* What exactly is R and why do we use it?

* The Rstudio way of interfacing with R

* The R language simplified

* A live demonstration of how to create a regression model using R

---

#  What exactly is R and why do we use it?

--

`1.`  R is a programming language

--

`2.`  R is an environment for data analysis 

--

R is one of the most popular platforms for data analysis, with an expanding user base as well as ever expanding funcitonality.

--

* Free, open source and available on all three major platforms

--

* Countless extensions (packages) and interfaces with other programmes

--

* Great community 

--

* Making reproducibile research the norm

--

* Excellent data visualisation capabilities

# Rstudio


* Difference between plain old R and Rstudio.

--

* Other IDEs (Integrated development environemnts)

--

* Rstudio layout:
  + console---command window
  + script window---editor
  + workspace & history window + more
  + files, plots, packages, help + more

---

# The R language simplified

* calculations

* variable assignment

* vectors and data types 

* functions
  + base R
  + written by us
  + from packages

* data frames
